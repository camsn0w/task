Following a conversation with Dan I was told that I didn't need to write tests and instead should include what I would test.



Some more things that I would test:
- Receiving invalid responses from the APIs (like a 404, rate limit reached etc.)
- Speed for concurrent vs sequential requests
- Ensure that first and last name matches what's in the url (already have this)
- Really long jokes, empty jokes and short jokes
- Really long names, empty names and short names
